# SublimeOptimizer

Created this repo playing around with creating a sublime package installer tool to setup an ideal php editor.

Right now, all it is just a copy of my current setup. 

To use the tool, go into your Packages (~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages) and remove/backup your Users directory, or copy over it, which seems to half ass work, or I'm doing something wrong, one or the other. 

clone repo and copy to Users
